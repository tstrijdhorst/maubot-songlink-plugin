### Supports the following services:
* Spotify
* Bandcamp
* Deezer
* Youtube
* Youtube Music
* Napster
* SoundCloud
* Amazon Music
* Apple Music

### Output
If one of these services are matched in an URL but no link is found then the bot will output so. The only exception is youtube as youtube links are not guaranteed to be music. When no corresponding song.link page is found for a youtube video instead the bot outputs nothing.
